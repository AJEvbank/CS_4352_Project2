Run the scripts in this order:

build_directories.sh
make
test_scripts.sh

Note: test_scripts.sh is a bash script and must be run in bash. It will
show output for the program on several calls, as well as output from the
find utility. It will also create an inodes.txt file with inode numbers
for the files in the project.
